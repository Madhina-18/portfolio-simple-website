# My First Portfolio Website
Welcome to all..!
This is my very first portfolio website, created using HTML and basic CSS. It consists of two pages: *Home* and *Contact*. The Home page provides an introduction to my skills and experience, while the Contact page offers a simple way to get in touch with me. I built this website to practice my web development skills and to create an online presence for showcasing my work.

## Features:
- *Home Page*: Highlights my skills and provides a brief introduction.
- *Contact Page*: Offers contact information for easy communication.
- Basic, responsive layout designed to work on various screen sizes.
- Clean and minimal design focusing on functionality and content.

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS

This project is a stepping stone in my web development journey. Feel free to check it out!
